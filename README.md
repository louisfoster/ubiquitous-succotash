# Yes, this is that project you were looking for

The one that makes you wonder if you really are "out of ideas" for what to do with code. A little ambitious as a pitch, but I'll try my best to keep you engaged.

## iOS

The project is being actively developed with modern xcode and swift in mind:
- Xcode 9
- Targeting iOS 11
- Swift 4

Nothing special for setup, just make sure you load the workspace, not the project.


## Docs

The docs for this project are written in a journal style, if you want code documentation, just read the comments around the code as they are quite clear.

[View the docs on Github Pages](https://louisfoster.github.io/ubiquitous-succotash/), or, install Jekyll to view locally (don't ask me how, it took me forever and I'm sure it's different for each machine) - instructions are only a Google search away!


## About

The openness of this is intentional as I hope it might one day serve as a learning tool, or a terrible boilerplate, or as something I use to launch another interesting thing. I'm lucky enough to have the knowledge to understand most of what I'm doing in this project and will do my best to explain as I go along. If you think this is cool but want to contact me for some reason about this project, there are heaps of options with PRs and issues and comments and wiki etc etc.

Note, there is no plan to actively maintain this project if I stop, nor any liability for using the dodgy code I write. I'm doing this for my own fun.
